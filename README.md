#Buffer Overflow

The objective of this project is to learn how to analyze whether a program has a buffer
overflow (BOF) vulnerability, how to exploit BOF and how to defend against BOF.
BOF is an anomaly that violates memory safety. If you give an input that is longer
than expected length, it would be written out of bounds to a block of fixed pre-
allocated memory. This situation leads to data corruption and crash of the program
or executes malicious codes by changing control flow of the program.
